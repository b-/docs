# Translations

Translations are now managed on Transifex, which is an online website where everyone can contribute and translate strings for our project. It automatically syncs with the main language file \(in English\) and,, for you to contribute, you just need to:

1. Go to our Transifex web page: [explore.transifex.com/file-browser/file-browser](https://explore.transifex.com/file-browser/file-browser/)
2. Click on **Join the project** and pick your language. We'll accept you as soon as possible.
   * Isn't your language available? Go down to the bottom of the page and request a language! We'll accept it too 😁🌍🌎🌏
